# Project 02: Recipe-app

The Recipe Management System is a web application that allows users to manage and organize their cooking recipes. Users can create, edit, view, and delete recipes. Each recipe includes a list of ingredients, detailed cooking instructions, and estimated preparation time. Users can also manage a list of ingredients available in their pantry and generate a shopping list based on the ingredients they need for selected recipes. The application aims to simplify meal planning and ensure users have all necessary ingredients before cooking.
